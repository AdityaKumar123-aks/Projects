# Single Phase Active Filter for Harmonic Compensation

Course Project - EN 662 | Modelling and Control of Inverter Based Renewable Resources

Instructor: Prof. D Venkatramanan, DESE, IIT Bombay 


## 📌 Project Overview

This project involved the design and simulation of a 1-phase Active Power Filter (APF) using a Voltage Source Inverter (VSI). The primary goal was to achieve harmonic compensation in compliance with international power quality standards.

**Timeline:** January 2025 – April 2025 

**Location:** DESE, IIT Bombay 


## 🚀 Key Technical Contributions
 
**Harmonic Suppression:** Designed a 1-phase APF that maintains source-current well below the **IEEE-519 THD limit of 5%**.

**Control Strategy:** Implemented a PI DC-bus regulator with specific gains (, ) to stabilize voltage without overshoot under dynamic load conditions.

**Modeling & Validation:** Formulated precise state-space models for both the controller and the active filter to drive accurate simulation results.
