# Performance Evaluation of Back-to-Back 2-Level VSC

Course Assignment - EN 659 | Modeling and Control of IBRR 

## 📌 Project Overview

This project focuses on the performance analysis of a back-to-back 2-level Voltage Source Converter (VSC) operating under open-loop control. The study specifically compares the efficiency and harmonic performance of Centered Space Vector PWM (CSVPWM) against Sinusoidal Triangle PWM (STPWM) across all four quadrants of operation.
